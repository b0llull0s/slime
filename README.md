# slime Roadmap
## Tier 1: Advanced Obfuscation & Evasion

### Code Obfuscation:
- Polymorphic XOR keys - Generate random keys per execution
- Control flow obfuscation - Add junk instructions, fake branches
- String encryption - AES/ChaCha20 for command strings
- Anti-debugging - PTRACE detection, timing checks
- Packing evolution - Custom packers, multiple layers
### Binary Evasion:
- Entropy manipulation - Make packed binary look normal
- Import obfuscation - Dynamic API resolution
- Section name randomization - Avoid suspicious names
- Certificate spoofing - Sign with legitimate-looking certs

## Tier 2: Stealth & OPSEC

### Runtime Stealth:
- Process name spoofing - Masquerade as legitimate processes
- Parent process validation - Only run from expected parents
- Timestomping - Match file timestamps to system files
- Memory-only execution - Reflective loading, no disk artifacts
- Log evasion - Avoid triggering common monitoring
### Network Stealth:
- DNS over HTTPS - Exfiltrate via DoH
- Traffic shaping - Mimic legitimate protocols
- Domain fronting - Hide C2 behind CDNs
- Steganography - Hide data in images/documents

## Tier 3: Advanced Reconnaissance

### System Intelligence:
- EDR/AV detection and fingerprinting
- Sandbox detection (VM artifacts, timing)
- Privilege escalation path enumeration
- Lateral movement opportunities
- Domain enumeration (if domain-joined)
- Container/cloud environment detection
### Adaptive Reconnaissance:
- Environment-aware command selection
- Risk-based execution (avoid noisy commands)
- Credential harvesting (memory, files, registry)
- Network topology mapping
- Service enumeration with version detection

## Tier 4: Professional Features

### Operational Security:
- Self-destruct mechanisms - Time-based or trigger-based
- Execution logging - Encrypted logs for post-op analysis
- Failure handling - Graceful degradation, no crashes
- Resource monitoring - CPU/memory usage limits
- Persistence options - Multiple installation methods
### Modularity & Flexibility:
- Plugin architecture - Loadable reconnaissance modules
- Configuration profiles - Different modes (stealth/speed/comprehensive)
- Custom payloads - User-defined command sequences
- Output formatting - JSON, XML, custom formats
- Encryption - All output encrypted with operator keys

## Tier 5: Elite Level Features

### Advanced Techniques:
- Living off the land - Use only built-in OS tools
- Fileless operation - Pure memory execution
- Kernel-level hooks - Rootkit-style hiding
- Hardware fingerprinting - Unique system identification
- Behavioral analysis - Learn normal vs suspicious activity
### Intelligence Integration:
- Threat intel feeds - IOC checking, reputation scoring
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping - Technique classification
- Risk scoring - Automated vulnerability assessment
- Report generation - Professional penetration test reports
## Implementation Priority
- Phase 1 (Immediate): Tier 1 obfuscation + basic stealth
- Phase 2 (Short-term): Tier 2 OPSEC + Tier 3 adaptive recon
- Phase 3 (Medium-term): Tier 4 professional features
- Phase 4 (Long-term): Tier 5 elite capabilities
